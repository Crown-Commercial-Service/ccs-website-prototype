## An Unbranded version of the GDS Prototyping kit, serving CCS styles

### About the Prototype Kit

The Prototype Kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on GOV.UK and CCS. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

### Read the project principles.

- Make sure prototypes are password-protected
  If you publish your prototypes online, they must be protected by a password. This is to prevent members of the public finding prototypes and thinking they are real services.

You must protect user privacy at all times, even when using prototypes. Prototypes made with the kit look like GOV.UK, but do not have the same security provisions. Always make sure you are handling user data appropriately.

### Installation instructions

- npm install
- npm run dev (to run locally)

### Styling the build

- use the ccs-layout.html file in the layouts folder with the unbranded version of the kit

### Node version requirements

We always recommend you use the current long term support (LTS) version of Node.js.

The Prototype Kit always supports at least the current and previous LTS releases.
